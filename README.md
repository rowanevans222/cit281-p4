We built a Node.js REST API to manage a simple questions-and-answers dataset. Create files for data, module functions (to get questions/answers and handle errors), and an Express server to serve requests. Test your functions with provided code. Extra credit involves adding POST, PUT, DELETE support and deep cloning. This project helps practice modular coding, REST APIs, and error handling.
